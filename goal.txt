Goal
Deploy the hivemw-ce broker on Kubernetes as normal deployment without using helm charts or hivemq k8s operator.

In my project, I include file-rbac extension and Prometheus extension to configure and monitor my broker. extensions folder contains hivemq-file-rbac-extension and hivemq-Prometheus-extension

each subfolder contains extension files to run the extension inside the broker it contains extension-config.xml, hivemq-extension.xml, credentials.xml and jar file to authenticate the users and permissions, lly prometheus contains jar, config and extension files.

In the previous deployment, everything was built as a docker image and with docker-compose the individual services like hivemq, Prometheus and Grafana.

Now I don't want to put my credentials.xml file inside a docker container, for that I used the k8s secret object to create as secret and mount as volumes and volume mount in the deployment. when i pass those the hivemq asks for the credentials at the location "/opt/hivemq/extensions/credentials.xml". when I pass those as secret the problem is overwriting the existing files in the extension folder for that I used the 'subpath' method but still no use.

How do we solve this issue is there any subpath to provide credentails.xml? ( hivemq/hivemq-file-rbac-extension#3 ) but still, we can see the secrets in the mounted directory by default hivemq looks in the extension folder.
Use either external hosting repos to store secrets or initialise a sidecar container and mount secrets into that, and the main container won't show credentials. 

If you think of any approaches please let me. I would like to hear from you soon.
